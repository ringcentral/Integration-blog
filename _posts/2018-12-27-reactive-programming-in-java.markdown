# Reactive programming in Java

Nowdays the notion of reactive programming is becoming more and more popular. So what is reactive programming, and what is the problem it is trying to resolve? Let's get started by its defintion in Wikipedia: "Reactive Programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change."

### Why do we need reactive programming?
The simple answer is that we want to make our application more responsive to improve the user experience. There is one important word in the reactive programming definition: asynchronous. You are notified when data is emitted in the stream asynchronously – meaning independently to the main program flow. By structuring your program around data streams, you are writing asynchronous code: you write code invoked when the stream emits a new item. The concepts of threads, blocking code, and side-effects are very important in this context.

In the traditional programming model, there is one dilemma we need to face: ***Blocking***. The modern applications usually need to accommodate a huge number of concurrent users, so performance is becoming a key conern. In traditional ways, we often program using blocking code. When there is a performance bottleneck normally we introduce additional threads runing similar blocking code which is very wastefull. Compared to the threads model, the reactive programming is non-blocking, asynchronous and resilient.

### When do we use reactive programming and what is the benefit?
The key expected benefit of reactive and non-blocking is the ability to scale with a small, fixed number of threads and less memory. That makes applications more resilient under load because they scale in a more predictable way. It allows you to treat streams of asynchronous events with the same sort of simple, composable operations that you use for collections of data items like arrays. It frees you from tangled webs of callbacks, and thereby makes your code more readable and less prone to bugs.

### Reactive extension
In software programming, Reactive Extensions is a set of tools allowing imperative programming languages to operate on sequences of data regardless of whether the data is synchronous or asynchronous. It provides a set of sequence operators that operate on each item in the sequence. Like ReactiveX, it's not only a API but provide the library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It includes a set of lanuage implementation like RxJava, RxJS, RxCPP, etc. 

### Introduction to RxJava
There are different implementation on Java for reactive programming, like:
- Java 9 Flow API
- RxJava
- Reactor 

Here I would like to take RxJava as an example. 
To use RxJava in our Maven project, we’ll need to add the following dependency to our pom.xml:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjava</artifactId>
    <version>${rx.java.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
There are two key types to understand when working with RxJava:

- An observable represents any object that can get data from a data source and whose state may be of interest to the other objects may register an interest
- An observer is any object that wishes to be notified when the state of another object changes.
An observer subscribes to an Observable sequence. The sequence sends items to the observer one at a time.

The observer handles each one before processing the next one. If many events come in asynchronously, they must be stored in a queue or dropped.

In Rx, an observer will never be called with an item out of order or called before the callback has returned for the previous item.
Create Observable like below:
```
Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("Hello");
observable.subscribe(s -> result = s);
  
assertTrue(result.equals("Hello"));
```
The example on three different methods on the observer interface: OnNext, OnError, and OnCompleted
```
String[] letters = {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"};
Observable<String> observable = Observable.from(letters);
observable.subscribe(
  i -> result += i,  //OnNext
  Throwable::printStackTrace, //OnError
  () -> result += "_Completed" //OnCompleted
);
assertTrue(result.equals("abcdefg_Completed"));
```
The sample for itertor:
```
List<String> words = Arrays.asList(
 "the",
 "quick",
 "brown",
 "fox",
 "jumped",
 "over",
 "the",
 "lazy",
 "dogs"
);

Observable.fromIterable(words)
 .flatMap(word -> Observable.fromArray(word.split("")))
 .distinct()
 .sorted()
 .zipWith(Observable.range(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE),
   (string, count) -> String.format("%2d. %s", count, string))
 .subscribe(System.out::println);
```
with the result:
```
 1. a
 2. b
 3. c
 4. d
 5. e
 6. f
 7. g
 8. h
 9. i
10. j
11. k
12. l
13. m
14. n
15. o
16. p
17. q
18. r
19. s
20. t
21. u
22. v
23. w
24. x
25. y
26. z
```
### Conclusion
We've talked about the concept of reactive programming, the benefits, how we can use it, and different implementations using RxJava as the example. Basically, reactive programming is a concept and methodology, different people or groups might have different views or interpretations on it, but one simple word on the purpose is to make the application more responsive to provide the high performance to our users
