## About RingCentral Embeddable widgets

RingCentral Embeddable widgets is a powerful tool for CRMs, its core power is add click-to-call function, around this core function, it can extend CRM's communication workflow. And it can be easily integrated into CRM sites, even without official support, developer can still do the integration through building chrome extension.

## Advanced features of these extensions could provide

[Embbnux Ji](https://github.com/embbnux) has a tuturial: [Building Chrome Extension Integrations with RingCentral Embeddable](https://medium.com/ringcentral-developers/build-a-chrome-extension-with-ringcentral-embeddable-bb6faee808a3), with this tutorial, we could create Chrome extension for any site with RingCentral Embeddable.

For CRM sites, we may want to add more advanced features, like click-to-call buttons/links and all the third party features of our ringcentral-embeddable supported:

- For CRM contact list, extension could add hover-to-show tooltip to show click-to-call button.

## Create extension with CLI tool

To minimize the effort to create these extensions, I created the CLI tool: [ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory)

Use CLI tool to init a extension project will be like this:

```bash
# make sure you have npm@5.2+ installed
npx ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory my-app
```

Then just follow the instruction inmy-app/README.md to build, test and develop the extension.

I have a demo video to show this process.

As you can see, before setting proper config/functions, it will work as a **Embeddable widgets** only, if you are satisfied with this, it is already done! If you want the extension to do the listed features above, you need more work to get there. The tutorial and examples would be a good place to start.
